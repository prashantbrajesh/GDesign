A GOOD DESIGN IS ONE THAT FINDS POWERFUL YET **SIMPLE ABSTRACTIONS**, MAKING A COMPLEX PROBLEM **TRACTABLE**


“TO HAVE POWERFUL ENOUGH ABSTRACTIONS (THE RIGHT ONES) TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO MODEL YOUR PATH TO PRODUCTION EFFECTIVELY AND, IMPORTANTLY, REMODEL IT AS YOU LEARN AND EVOLVE IT OVER TIME WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, **RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO CONTINUOUSLY INTRODUCE NEW, UNNECESSARY ABSTRACTIONS** THAT ARE ONLY GOING TO MAKE THINGS MORE DIFFICULT IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE THEY WILL BE **LEAKY**”
